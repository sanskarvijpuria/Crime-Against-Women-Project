# Crime-Against-Women-Project
A data analysis project on a Crime Against Women dataset. 

The notebook contains the graphs using the **Plotly libaray**.
This project also has an implementation of a choropleth map.

*Github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.*

You can view the notebook with plotly graph output on Jovian.ai-  [Click here](https://jovian.ai/skv9403/crime-against-women-final).
