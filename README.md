# Crime-Against-Women-Project
A data analysis project on a Crime Against Women dataset. 

The notebook contains the graphs using the **Plotly libaray**.
This project also has an implementation of a choropleth map of india.

You might not be available to view the graphs on the Github notebook viewer because *Github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.*
